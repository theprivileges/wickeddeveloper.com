I'm a Brazilian who got lost in Montana.  I am passionate about privacy and the decentralized web.  I currently work at [ENERCALC,LLC](https://enercalc.com?ref=luiz) as a Sr. DevOps Developer.  Whenever I am not on the computer you can find me: practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, reading, or doing one of the many outdoor activities in Montana.
