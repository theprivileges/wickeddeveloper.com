I'm a Brazilian who got lost in Montana.  I am passionate about privacy and the web.  I currently work at [Submittable.com](https://www.submittable.com?ref=luiz) as a Senior Software Engineer.  Whenever I am not on the computer you can find me: fly fishing, practicing Yoga, practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, or doing one of the many outdoor activities in Montana.
