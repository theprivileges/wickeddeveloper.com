After many years of recommending younger developer to start their own blog, I am finally taking my own advice. 

I plan on using this platform to document lessons learned in every day life.  I hope to create a repository of principles that I have amassed over the years.  Posts will cover an array of subjects, from books I've read, articles I learned from, systems and processes I've implemented at work, and much more. 

My ultimate goal with this blog is to improve my communication skills, and share knowledge along the way.
